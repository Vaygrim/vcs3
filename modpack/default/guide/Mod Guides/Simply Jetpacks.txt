§0§lDescription:§r
Adds several Redstone Flux-powered jetpacks to the game. The jetpack uses the chest armor slot, and each pack has different characteristics.

§0§lGetting Started:§r
You will need an existing Redstone Flux (RF) energy network to charge the jetpack. There are two controls, one toggles the jetpack on/off, and the other turns Hover Mode on/off. Hover Mode will cause you to slowly descend when you stop flying upwards, but uses more power. Jump to go up, L-shift to go down.

§0§lTips:§r
-  A Flux Pack is a handy way to charge your jetpack when you're on the go.
-  Running out of power while in-flight should be avoided.
