§0§lDescription:§r
EnderTech is an add-on mod for Thermal Expansion. It adds Ender-based technology to the Thermal Expansion tech tree. There are charging or healing pads, high-density liquid storage, and other useful items.

§0§lGetting Started:§r
Because these items are expensive to build and require power infrastructure, EnderTech is usually accessed mid to late-game.
