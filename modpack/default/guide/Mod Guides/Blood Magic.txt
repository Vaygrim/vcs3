§1§lBlood Magic§r

§0§lDescription:§r
§oWith great power comes great... danger.§r
Blood Magic is an arcane art wherein mages attempt to gather power through the use of blood.


§0§lGetting Started:§r
Food. You will need it to heal. Craft a Blood Altar and a Sacrificial Knife. Place a diamond in the altar by using it (r-click) on the altar. It should start spinning. Now hold the Sacrificial Knife in your hand and use it on the altar. You should see a pool of... life essence in the bowl, and you just lost a heart of health. It takes 10 hearts worth of... essence... to complete the transformation of the diamond to a Blood Orb. The Orb will bind to you when you remove it from the altar (r-click).

§0§lTips:§r
-  Leave lots of room around the Blood Altar, it will expand to a very large structure.
-  The Dagger of Sacrifice will allow you to make use of another's essence, if you poke them with it while they are near the altar
