§1§lRemain In Motion§r

§0§lDescription:§r
Connect blocks to carriage frameworks to create large, automated moving structures.

§0§lGetting Started:§r
You will need the Remain In Motion Screwdriver to configure your structure. Craft frameworks, then attach blocks to the frameworks to create structures with potentially very complex motion.

§0§lTips:§r
-  Start with very simple structures.
-  Test each phase of the motion individually, before automating more complex motions.
-  Only place chunk loaders on structures that have been thoroughly tested.
