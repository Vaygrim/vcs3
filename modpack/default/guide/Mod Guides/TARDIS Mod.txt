§1§lTARDIS Mod§r

§0§lDescription:§r
An extra-dimensional base-in-box that travels through space and traverses dimensional boundaries. Simple as that, really.

§0§lGetting Started:§r
Using a looted or crafted Kontron Crystal, craft a key then right-click the key to materialize your TARDIS. Right-click the key on the door to start your journey. You will find your Sonic Screwdriver in the console; use it to modify your TARDIS. As you travel, your TARDIS will gain experience, which will unlock additional features.

§0§lTips:§r

-  Activate the Land-Ground control prevent "landing" in mid-air... and the sudden drop thereafter.
-  Elevator names are coded with 3 numbers:
    <a> vertical size
    <b> intermediate levels
    <c> built at level
