§1§lMagical Crops§r

§0§lDescription:§r
Using Magical Crops, you can grow almost any resource in the game. Create the seed, grow the plants to maturity, then harvest the essence. Combine the essence to make a resource.

§0§lGetting Started:§r
Use 8 Minicio Essence and one Seed to create a Minicio Seed. Most recipes start with Minicio seeds.

§0§lTips:§r
-  There are two ways to create new plant species: Magical Crops essence + an Infusion stone, or by using Agricraft to mutate new plants.
-  If you will be using the Infusion Stones to make new plants, create a Minicio garden early on, to start stockpiling essence.
-  The various growth-accelerating items (Watering Can, Fertilized Earth, etc.) will dramatically increase your productivity.  
-  Using Agricraft, you can breed improved plants that are MUCH more productive
