§1§lIron Backpacks§r

§0§lDescription:§r
Similar to the Iron Chests mod, Iron Backpacks adds several tiers of packs that have increasing storage. There are a variety of upgrades for the packs that can add useful features.


§0§lGetting Started:§r
Craft a backpack! The "upgrade points" for each pack show how upgradeable the pack is. Each upgrade will use some points. Upgrades are applied to a pack by using a crafting grid. Upgrades can get pretty pricey, but an upgraded, configured backpack is a very useful thing!

§0§lTips:§r
-  Right-click while holding a pack to rename it.
-  A backpack can be upgraded, so start with the lowest tier and add storage as you need.
-  The Depth upgrade will allow you to access a pack within your pack
