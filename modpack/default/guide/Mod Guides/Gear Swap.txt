§1§lGear Swap§r

§0§lDescription:§r
Gear Swap adds a block to the game which allows you to quickly swap your armor and hotbar equipment to one of four customized settings, just by clicking the block.

§0§lGetting Started:§r
Craft the Gear Swap block. The four squares on the block are the four customizable configurations for your hotbar and armor. Sneak-left-click on a square to set that square to your current equipment configuration. Right-clicking on a square will set your current hotbar and equipment to the settings for that square. Right-click anywhere else on the block to open a GUI where each of the four settings can be configured.

§0§lTips:§r
-  When trying to supply the equipment & items for a new selection, the block will first try to pull from your inventory, then from its own 4x4 grid inventory, then it will look at adjacent chests.
-  Each block has a different texture but does the same thing.
-  Baubles can also be configured.
