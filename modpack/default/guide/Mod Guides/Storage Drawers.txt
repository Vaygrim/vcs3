§1§lStorage Drawers§r

§0§lDescription:§r
Storage, but more like bins or barrels than chests. Each drawer can only hold a single stack of items, and the blocks can be crafted as full-depth or half-depth, with drawers arranged in a 1x1, 1x2, or 2x2 configuration. Without any upgrades, each drawer can hold from 4-32 stacks depending upon the depth of the unit and the number of drawers -- the more drawers in the block, the fewer stacks each drawer can hold.

§0§lGetting Started:§r
Storage Drawers have no inventory UI, so it can be a bit awkward to use one at first. Here's how to interact with a drawer:
§0§l right-click:§r insert a stack into the drawer
§0§l double right-click:§r insert ALL compatible stacks from your inventory
§0§l left-click:§r remove a single item
§0§l shift left-click:§r remove a full stack
§0§l shift right-click (empty hand):§r open the management UI

§0§lTips:§r
-  Use a Drawer Key to lock an item to a drawer so that, even when empty, only that item can go into it.
-  Capacity upgrades can be applied in any order, and can stack, if there are sufficient upgrade slots.
-  An indicator upgrade will give a visual representation of how full the drawer is.
