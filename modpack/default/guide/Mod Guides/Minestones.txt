§0§lDescription:§r
Minestones is a "card battle" type game played on a 3x3 grid laid out on the ground. A player claims a square in the grid by playing a minestone that has more spikes than the adjacent minestones. The player with the most squares wins.

§0§lGetting Started:§r
Minestones are random drops from mobs. Over time or if you have a monster farm, you can accumulate quite a large collection of them. Create the grid on the ground, then take turns placing your stones. Rules vary, but it is common to only play with the minestones on your hotbar. 

§0§lTips:§r
-  Since all the stones use the same item ID, the Filing Cabinet from Extra Utilities is a convenient way to store a large collection.
